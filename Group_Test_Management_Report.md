## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)
### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly | State Management |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | Data Persistence |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles â†’ doubles score | Business Logic | 

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- ensure that the Word Puzzle Game works has expected from word unscrample, guess validation  works has expected.
- all scoring rules provided are applied to the game correctly
- The leadersboard should pesist has expected from the rules. i.e the top 3 scores should be displayed only.
- Bonus is applied correctly to the game after every 3 puzzles. 
-  Reset button clears scores and progrogress but the leadersboard is not interfered with.
- testing the input fields and all buttons are working seemlessly has expected.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- chrome browser destop only test
- the score, solved and bonus counters working has expected.
- leadersboard saved to localStorage even after reply or reset 
- rules display
- input field are accepting the input from the user.
- input validation
- hint button apply the deduction of 2 points and the award is changed to 5 
- bonus is triggered at the third correct guess and the points are doubled.
- correct submit guess is adding 10 points to the score.
- new puszzle changes the puzzle to be solved.
- reset button clear the puzzle score, solved data 
- leadersboard should have the top 3 scores saved in the browser.
- Rules should be displayed for testing the accurancy of the game.

**Out of Scope:**
-  backend integration
- small screen responsiveness
- other browsers testing environment other than chrome desktop.
- user authetication
- the scores analytics.
-  other scores that are not in top 3
- the length of the guessed work
- UI and css styling

## Test Control & Project Management

### Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Actual Output | Variance | Owner |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Planning | Test plan with entry/exit criteria | Completed as specified | None | Test Manager |
| Risk Analysis | 7 risks identified & prioritized | Met requirement (minimum of 6) | +1 extra risk | Risk Analyst |
| Test Design | 9 test cases (5 risk-based, 2 negative, 1 usability) | Exceeded minimum (minimum of  8) | +2 cases | All team |
| Execution | All tests executed with evidence | 90% pass rate achieved | None | Test Executor |
| Defect Logging | 3 GitHub issues with full details | Met requirement | None | Test Executor |
| Metrics | Calculated and visualized all metrics | Completed | None | Test Manager |

**Progress Tracking Method:**   shared markdown document document for real-time collaboration among the 3 of us.

**Change Control Notes:** -  
 - Day 1: created a test plan by a test manager.
- Day 2: Added TC-09 after Risk Analyst identified scoring calculation gap  
- Day 3: added the defects by the test executor and updated the schedule.
- Day 4: phases of of delivarible and the output that was found 


## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature:  The Reset Game feature has the most critical defect. DEF-02 (scrambled word not visible after reset) completely breaks user workflow, making the game unplayable without a page reload. This highlights the importance of thorough state management testing during reset operations.
- Risk Analysis Impact:
Risk-based testing was highly effective. Prioritizing R-01 (Bonus Round) as Critical led to allocating 2 test cases, which validated the most complex business logic early. The Likelihood Ã— Impact scoring helped avoid over-testing low-risk UI elements while ensuring 100% coverage of High/Critical risks.

- Team Communication Effectiveness: 
**Strengths:** Clear role separation prevented overlap, GitHub Issues provided transparency and single markdown document helped in updating progress effectively.  
**Challenges:** Initial scope confusion and the time limit among members as most of them are working.

- Improvements for Next Cycle: 
Automate some testing like regression testing, conduct daily meetings among the members to ensure that everyone's opinion is considered and it creates better project handling, create more time for exploratory testing and finally we can schedule more meetings for defect analysis.
