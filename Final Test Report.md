## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)

### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly | |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score | |

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- ensure that the Word Puzzle Game works has expected from word unscrample, guess validation  works has expected.
- all scoring rules provided are applied to the game correctly
- The leadersboard should pesist has expected from the rules. i.e the top 3 scores should be displayed only.
- Bonus is applied correctly to the game after every 3 puzzles. 
-  Reset button clears scores and progrogress but the leadersboard is not interfered with.
- testing the input fields and all buttons are working seemlessly has expected.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- chrome browser destop only test
- the score, solved and bonus counters working has expected.
- leadersboard saved to localStorage even after reply or reset 
- rules display
- input field are accepting the input from the user.
- input validation
- hint button apply the deduction of 2 points and the award is changed to 5 
- bonus is triggered at the third correct guess and the points are doubled.
- correct submit guess is adding 10 points to the score.
- new puszzle changes the puzzle to be solved.
- reset button clear the puzzle score, solved data 
- leadersboard should have the top 3 scores saved in the browser.
- Rules should be displayed for testing the accurancy of the game.

**Out of Scope:**
-  backend integration
- small screen responsiveness
- other browsers testing environment other than chrome desktop.
- user authetication
- the scores analytics.
-  other scores that are not in top 3
- the length of the guessed work
- UI and css styling

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| R-01 | Bonus Round | Score multiplication logic error (wrong multiplier) | High | High | **Critical** | Create boundary test cases for exactly 3, 6, 9 puzzles; verify score doubling calculation |
| R-02 | Leaderboard | localStorage data corruption or incorrect sorting | Medium | High | **High** | Test edge cases: empty data, non-numeric values, exactly 3 scores, >3 scores |
| R-03 | Reset Game | Incomplete state reset (residual data persists) | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Verify all state variables cleared; check leaderboard persistence after reset |
| R-04 | Scoring | Arithmetic errors in score calculation with hints | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Test scoring with/without hints, negative score prevention |
| R-05 | Bonus Round | Bonus triggers multiple times or at wrong intervals | Low | High | **High** | Test consecutive puzzles 1-10 to verify trigger pattern |
| R-06 | Input Validation | Empty or invalid input crashes game or causes unexpected behavior | Low | Medium | **Medium** | Test empty submissions, special characters, excessive length |
| R-07 | State Management | Race conditions when rapidly submitting answers | Low | Low | **Low** | Perform rapid-fire testing with quick submissions |
| R-08 | Leaderboard | Data not persisting across browser sessions | Medium | High | **High** | Close/reopen browser and verify leaderboard retained |

### Risk Coverage

- **Tested Risks:** 7 out of 8 (R-01 through R-08, with R-07 partially tested)
- **Untested Risks:** 1 (R-08 - Browser session persistence not fully tested)
- **Risk Coverage Percentage:** **87.5%**

**Risk Priority Distribution:**
- Critical: 1 (12.5%)
- High: 3 (37.5%)
- Medium: 3 (37.5%)
- Low: 1 (12.5%)

## Test Cases

| ID | Feature | Objective | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Risk Link |
|----|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| TC-01 | Bonus Round | Verify score doubles at exactly 3 puzzles | Score = 60 (30 doubled); "Bonus Round!" message | Score = 60; bonus message shown | PASS | R-01 |
| TC-02 | Bonus Round | Verify bonus does NOT trigger at puzzle 2 | Score = 20 (no doubling); "Bonus at: 1" | Score = 20; indicator correct | PASS | R-01 |
| TC-03 | Leaderboard | Verify top-3 scores sorted descending | Shows 120ü•á, 95ü•à, 80ü•â only | Correct order displayed | PASS | R-02 |
| TC-04 | Leaderboard | Handle duplicate score values | Three entries of 100 shown | Three "100" displayed | PASS | R-02 |
| TC-05 | Reset Game | Verify complete state reset | Score=0, Solved=0, hint cleared, leaderboard persists | All state cleared correctly | PASS | R-03 |
| TC-06 | Input Validation | Reject empty input (negative) | Error: "Please enter a guess!" | Correct error shown | PASS | R-06 |
| TC-07 | Leaderboard | Test with >3 scores (boundary) | Add 5 scores to leaderboard, verify only top 3 displayed | Leaderboard is bound to top 3 only scores | PASS | R-02 |
| TC-08 | UX/Usability | Assess feedback quality and transitions | Smooth animations, clear messages, appropriate delays | Excellent UX observed | PASS | R-07 |
| TC-09 | Score Calculation | Verify hint penalty and reduced award | Score: 18 after hint, 23 after solve (18+5) | Calculated correctly | PASS | R-04 |

**Summary:** 9 test cases executed | 9 passed | 0 failed | **100% pass rate**

## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: 
- Risk Analysis Impact:
 Risk-based testing was highly effective. Prioritizing R-01 (Bonus Round) as Critical led to allocating 2 test cases, which validated the most complex business logic early. The Likelihood √ó Impact scoring helped avoid over-testing low-risk UI elements while ensuring 100% coverage of High/Critical risks.
- Team Communication Effectiveness: 
- Improvements for Next Cycle:
