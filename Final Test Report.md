## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

-  Reset button clears scores and progrogress but the leadersboard is not interfered with.
- testing the input fields and all buttons are working seemlessly has expected.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- chrome browser destop only test
- the score, solved and bonus counters working has expected.
- leadersboard saved to localStorage even after reply or reset 
- rules display
- input field are accepting the input from the user.
- input validation
- hint button apply the deduction of 2 points and the award is changed to 5 
- bonus is triggered at the third correct guess and the points are doubled.
- correct submit guess is adding 10 points to the score.
- new puszzle changes the puzzle to be solved.
- reset button clear the puzzle score, solved data 
- leadersboard should have the top 3 scores saved in the browser.
- Rules should be displayed for testing the accurancy of the game.

**Out of Scope:**
-  backend integration
- small screen responsiveness
- other browsers testing environment other than chrome desktop.
- user authetication
- the scores analytics.
-  other scores that are not in top 3
- the length of the guessed work
- UI and css styling

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

 | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| R-01 | Bonus Round | Score multiplication logic error (wrong multiplier or timing) | High | High | *Critical* | Create boundary test cases for exactly 3, 6, 9 puzzles; verify score doubling calculation |
| R-02 | Leaderboard | localStorage data corruption or incorrect sorting | Medium | High | *High* | Test edge cases: empty data, non-numeric values, exactly 3 scores, >3 scores |
| R-03 | Reset Game | Incomplete state reset (residual data persists) | Medium | Medium | *Medium* | Verify all state variables cleared; check leaderboard persistence after reset |
| R-04 | Scoring | Arithmetic errors in score calculation with hints | Medium | Medium | *Medium* | Test scoring with/without hints, negative score prevention |
| R-05 | Bonus Round | Bonus triggers multiple times or at wrong intervals | Low | High | *High* | Test consecutive puzzles 1-10 to verify trigger pattern |
| R-06 | Input Validation | Empty or invalid input crashes game or causes unexpected behavior | Low | Medium | *Medium* | Test empty submissions, special characters, excessive length |
| R-07 | State Management | Race conditions when rapidly submitting answers | Low | Low | *Low* | Perform rapid-fire testing with quick submissions |
| R-08 | Leaderboard | Data not persisting across browser sessions | Medium | High | *High* | Close/reopen browser and verify leaderboard retained |
